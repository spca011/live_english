```

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spca011/live_english.git
cd live_english
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary Node.js packages.

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

You need to provide your Google Gemini API key. Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.

```
touch .env
```

Then, open the `.env` file and add your API key in the following format:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

**Important:** Do not share your `.env` file or commit it to Git. It is included in the `.gitignore` file to prevent this.

### 4. Run the Application

Start the backend server.

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start, and you can access the application by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

## Deployment

This application consists of a Node.js backend and a static frontend.

-   **Hosting**: You can deploy this application to services that support Node.js, such as Heroku, Vercel, Render, or Fly.io.
-   **Database**: The current version uses a `db.json` file. For a production environment, you might consider migrating to a more robust database solution like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or a cloud-based database service. The JSON file will be reset every time the hosting service's dyno restarts on free tiers.
-   **Environment Variables**: When deploying, make sure to set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` as an environment variable in your hosting provider's settings.

You cannot directly deploy this to static site hosts like GitHub Pages because it requires a running Node.js server.
